                I delved into my first AMR project at Botsync, focusing on BollorÃ©'s MAG300 Cart Lifter in preparation for multiple client demonstrations and 
                subsequent deployment to BollorÃ©. This endeavor posed numerous technical challenges, notably in connecting the robot to the Fleet Management Server (FMS) 
                and optimizing its navigation amid persistent errors, requiring continuous troubleshooting. As I was just starting off my internship, the extensive troubleshooting
                initially felt overwhelming, given my simultaneous learning curve in operating the AMR. Guided by my supervisor and the engineers from India's Botsync Team, I 
                navigated through the challenges, gradually mastering the intricacies of operating and troubleshooting the MAG300 AMR. After persistent troubleshooting and fine-tuning,
                I successfully executed the MAG300 Cart Lifter's Pick & Place task, a process spanning about two weeks but feeling like a month due to the meticulous debugging. 
                Reflecting on this experience highlighted the pivotal role of effort and determination in achieving success, irrespective of one's initial knowledge. Moreover, the 
                collaboration with diverse teams from different nationalities significantly enhanced my communication skills and teamwork.

                My most extensive project with our Botsync AMRs involved the KEMIN MAG1000 Lifter, spanning from operations, fine-tuning, all the way to deployment. 
                Beginning in the early weeks of my internship, I operated and fine-tuned the MAG1000 for client demonstrations, gaining in-depth insights into its hardware intricacies,
                including LiDAR, E-Stops, and Depth Camera, as well as the underlying software complexities built on ROS1. This knowledge proved crucial during the deployment at KEMIN,
                where challenges, particularly with Wi-Fi connectivity and site-specific environmental (objects placed around the warehouse) conditions, highlighted the need for 
                continuous troubleshooting. Recognizing that each deployment introduces unique issues, I realized the utmost importance of fine-tuning, constituting 10% of the 
                deployment process but influencing 80% of the robot's proper functionality. The effort invested in this phase ensured optimal AMR operation in diverse industrial settings.
                The deployment at KEMIN also involved conducting demonstrations, training sessions for personnel, and implementing safety measures, showcasing the multifaceted approach
                required for successful integration within the dynamic landscape of an industrial environment.

                At SANMINA, my experience working on the MAG300 Trolley Tugger was both challenging and rewarding. The troubleshooting began when the robot faced difficulties autonomously 
                navigating to the charging station due to Lidar issues, resulting in a dead battery. During maintenance, we removed the Tugger, documenting the screw locations for future 
                reassembly. Swapping the faulty Lidar and realigning it was crucial for successful navigation. The MAG300's unique features, such as its ability to open automatic sliding doors 
                and execute tasks via a tablet, added complexity. Setting up the charging station demanded meticulous attention, involving Python scripting, debugging, and adjustments to accommodate
                different charging pad lengths. Overcoming challenges like FMS connectivity issues, undocking glitches, and a malfunctioning charging station showcased the need for collaboration 
                with external engineers. Ultimately, successfully swapping charging stations and conducting rigorous testing ensured the MAG300's seamless functionality, providing valuable insights
                for future robot deployments. Throughout the journey, I understood the great importance of maintaining robots after its deployment to ensure proper efficiency of its workflows as 
                well as high uptime to satisfy the clientsâ€™ needs throughout their usage.
