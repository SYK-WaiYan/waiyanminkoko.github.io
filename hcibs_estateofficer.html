                As the Temporary Estate Officer at
               <a href="https://www.hcibs.edu.sg/" class = "link" target = "_blank">Hwa Chong Institution Boarding School (HCIBS),</a> 
                in December 2022, I had the privilege of overseeing the smooth operation of estate projects and ensuring the 
                maintenance of the boarding school facilities. My experiences there were nothing short of enriching.
            </p>

                One of my most significant responsibilities was supervising five enthusiastic interns from ITE College East.
                I was thrilled to mentor and train them, passing on my skills and knowledge so they could contribute positively
                to the workflow efficiency. Watching them grow and develop under my guidance was incredibly rewarding, and it 
                made me realize the importance of sharing knowledge and skills to those new to the field of facilities 
                management.

                I was also responsible for conducting daily inspections of the boarding school rooms and facilities to 
                ensure they were clean, safe, and up to the standards set by HCIBS. From checking for defects, maintenance
                issues, or safety hazards, I developed a keen eye for detail, understanding that even the smallest issue 
                could cause significant problems in the future.

                Overseeing the completion of the estate projects and various quarterly maintencene checks was another 
                experience that allowed me to develop my project management skills. It was my duty to check the progress 
                and quality of the projects, ensuring the contractor met the requirements and standards set by the boarding 
                school. The Estate projects were crucial for keeping up the boarding school's infrastructure, and making sure 
                they were of high quality was important for giving students a comfortable place to live and learn. 
                Through weekly checks and effective communication with contractors and other stakeholders, 
                I learned how to manage projects and ensure they were completed on time which in turn, 
                had a significant impact on the overall operations of the boarding school.

                During the World Cup 2022 finals, I was in charge of setting up the Function Room and it was an exhilarating experience.
                I had to make sure that everything was set up perfectly, from the projectors, audio system, and laptops, to the
                comfortable sitting areas for the boarders within an hour There were bite-sized snacks and refreshments being 
                catered hence, I was also in charge of making sure they were set-up in the Function room for the boarders to 
                easily enjoy. After a good half an hour or more, the Function Room was transformed into a cozy and welcoming 
                space, perfect for enjoying one of the most important games of the year. In the end, all my hard work paid off,
                and I was able to enjoy the fruit of my labor along with everyone else. It was a great experience, and I 
                am grateful to have been a part of it.

                After completely fulfilling my duty as a Temporary Estate Officer in the month of December 2022, I am left 
                with a profound sense of fulfillment. I was able to hone my leadership, communication, and attention to detail,
                all of which are essential skills in any field. But what truly made this experience special was the sense of
                responsibility I felt towards the safety and well-being of the students in the boarding school and one that 
                I will always treasure and protect. Looking back, I am grateful for this opportunity, and I am excited to apply
                the skills I learned to my future endeavors, wherever they may take me.
