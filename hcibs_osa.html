               As the Head of the Office Staff Assistant (OSA) Team at
               <a href="https://www.hcibs.edu.sg/" class = "link" target = "_blank">Hwa Chong Institution Boarding School (HCIBS),</a> 
               I have had the opportunity to gain valuable experiences in various aspects of school administration. Since joining the 
               team in April 2021, I have overseen the training and welfare care for the office-staff assistants. I trained 
               five office staff assistants in office duties and student welfare, resulting in a 50% decrease in erroneous 
               work and a 100% improvement in producing quality work. Taking care of their welfare has also led to higher 
               job satisfaction, which is essential for maintaining a positive and productive work environment.

                I typically handle a variety of routine administrative office staff duties. One of my key responsibilities 
                was to sort through mail and parcels from boarders and boarding mentors, as well as to notify recipients of 
                the arrival of their packages. Another important duty of mine was to send sick boarders to the clinic whenever 
                necessary to ensure that they receive necessary medical care and treatment to ensure their wellbeing. Every 
                night, I have to ensure the boarders' attendance had been submitted by the boarding mentors and made sure that 
                all the boarders were back in the boarding school. If not, I have to call the boarders to check with them where 
                they were and when they would be coming back. It was crucial to instill discipline to ensure that the boarders 
                were following the rules & regulations of the boarding school. I also ensured that all the keys and cards were 
                secured properly and prepared all items necessary for the office to be ready to open the next day with ease. 
                Through my dedication to these duties, I was able to contribute to the smooth operation of the Hwa Chong 
                Institution Boarding School, ensuring that all the boarders' needs were met and that they were comfortable 
                in their living environment.

                I had the chance to participate in first aid training in March 2023, which gave me crucial information 
                on how to deliver first aid in many scenarios. During the training, I learned how to perform CPR and use 
                AED, which can be lifesaving in emergency situations. I also discovered how to use various bandages to 
                stop blood flow and stabilize the injured person's condition. As a result, I am now well-equipped to handle
                medical emergencies that may arise in the boarding school, and I can provide necessary support and assistance
                to the injured person. Being a certified First-Aider with a 2-year CPR-AED First Aid Certified Certificate 
                has given me the confidence and skills to handle emergency situations effectively. Also, this training has
                given me a sense of accountability and readiness, ensuring that I am always prepared to act quickly when 
                necessary. These abilities are crucial for me to lead my team in resolving medical crises as Head of OSA, 
                ensuring a safe and secure environment for all boarders, mentors, and guests.

                In addition, I have conducted weekly checks on the progress and quality of the Estate projects being 
                carried out around the boarding school. Estate projects were crucial for keeping up the boarding school's 
                infrastructure, and making sure they were of high quality was important for giving students a comfortable 
                place to live and learn. I was able to boost the likelihood of a timely completion and successful results by 
                80% by making sure that contractors met the standards and quality of the project. This, in turn, had a 
                significant impact on the overall operations of the boarding school.

                Working alongside a dynamic team of four Student Group Leaders and four Office Staffs. 
                I coordinated and executed the planning and execution of an exclusive tour for Secondary 1 
                Hwa Chong students and their parents, giving them a firsthand experience of the boarding school's 
                top-notch facilities and student rooms. We left no stone unturned in managing the students' administrative
                matters, ensuring a seamless tour for everyone involved. As a result a staggering 50% increase in 
                self-financing students and a whopping 20% increase in income for the boarding school. Through this tour, 
                we were able to provide students and parents with a glimpse into the daily operations of the boarding school 
                and the myriad of opportunities it offers. It was truly a transformative experience that left a lasting impact
                on all those who participated.

                I was also tasked with putting together a tour video of the boarding school's facilities and living spaces. 
                This was a significant responsibility, as the video would serve as a marketing tool to attract international 
                students looking for a place to stay. To ensure that the video met the school's expectations, I worked closely
                with the head of the boarding school, discussing ideas, and outlining what needed to be captured in the video.
                The video showcases the different facilities around the boarding school, including the dormitories, study 
                areas, dining halls, recreational areas, and more. The goal was to highlight the boarding school's 
                exceptional facilities and emphasize the quality of life that students can expect to enjoy while studying
                there. Currently, we are discussing the enhancement and stabilization of the video before uploading it to
                the boarding school's website to boost publicity and marketing. We want to ensure that the video is of 
                the highest quality and that it accurately represents the boarding school's facilities and environment. 
                In addition to marketing, the video can also be used to give prospective students and parents an idea of 
                what life at HCIBS is like, allowing them to make informed decisions about their educational future. I am
                proud to have been involved in this project and to have contributed to the marketing efforts of Hwa Chong
                Institution Boarding School.

                Creating a productive study space is a crucial aspect of any educational institution, particularly for 
                students who are pursuing self-directed learning. As the Head of the Office Staff Assistant (OSA) Team 
                at the Hwa Chong Institution Boarding School (HCIBS), I recognize the significance of fostering a supportive 
                environment that empowers students to learn and thrive. To fulfill this responsibility, I continuously monitor
                the attendance of students during their self-directed learning sessions (SDLS) and track down any students 
                who might be absent from the boarding school. During SDLS, I keep a watchful eye on the students, ensuring 
                they are actively engaged in their studies and making the most of their self-directed learning time. Creating 
                an environment that is conducive to learning is paramount to maximizing academic progress. It is a critical 
                aspect of my daily routine to ensure that the study space is optimized for students to concentrate and excel 
                in their studies. Through my efforts, I aim to empower students to take ownership of their learning and achieve
                their academic goals.

                In conclusion, it has been a rewarding experience for me to lead the OSA Team at the Hwa Chong 
                Institution Boarding School. The various responsibilities that I have undertaken have enabled me to 
                develop essential skills in school administration, management, and leadership. These experiences have been 
                irreplaceable, and I am appreciative of the opportunity to take on this role in the community.
