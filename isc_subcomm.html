                Being a sub-committee member of the 
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thespisc/" class = "link" target = "_blank">Singapore Polytechnic International Students' Club (SPISC)</a> 
                has been one of my life's most fulfilling endeavors. I was cordially welcomed into a community of diverse and enthusiastic people who were 
                dedicated to having a good influence on the lives of international students at Singapore Polytechnic from the minute I joined the club 
                in October of 2021.

                As a sub-committee member, I collaborated with a group of 12 other committee members as a subcommittee member to 
                organize and carry out a total of 14 events between October 2021 and January 2023. These activities included both 
                physical and online activities, including the CCA Carnival, Leadership Training Camp, and Into The Nature. 
                Online activities included MONOSPY, Sotong Games and International Students' Freshmen Orientation Programme 1 (2022).
            </p>
            <p>
                Planning these events required a significant amount of teamwork, collaboration, and communication. 
                We had to work together to brainstorm ideas, assign tasks, and ensure that everything was on track for each event. 
                As a subcommittee member, I was responsible for helping with the planning and execution of the events, as well as 
                taking part in the events themselves.

                The Covid pandemic brought with it a set of challenges that we had never encountered before. 
                We had to move all our events online, which meant that we had to rethink our approach to organizing events. 
                The 
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CY-5_bvPAew/" class = "link" target = "_blank">MONOSPY</a>
                 
                event, which took place on December 29, 2021, was one of the very first events we scheduled during the epidemic. 
                It was an online event where the participants played a custom Monopoly game created by us with the element of truth or dare 
                within the game. 
            </p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <div class= "image">

            </div>
            <p>
                As a Group Leader, I oversaw the designing of our unique Monopoly board alongside my committee members as 
                well as organizing icebreaker activities to help the attendees get to know one another. The gap between organizing physical 
                events and online activities presented us with quite a few challenges because this was the club's first-ever online event. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The major challenge was communication because I had never met the committee members in person; instead, we only had virtual 
                meetings while we organized the events. Yet, despite the numerous obstacles and problems my committee and I encountered, we 
                were able to successfully plan and carry out the event. I took a lot of the lessons I learned from our first event to heart 
                when preparing for subsequent events.

                , an event with a Squid Game theme, was a resounding success! Held on the 29th of January 2022, 
                it was an online collaboration event with

                that saw enthusiastic participants 
                from both schools come together to experience an online version of the Squid Game Event.

                As the Video Director & Editor and Group Leader, 
                I played an integral role in ensuring the success of the event. I directed and edited the videos that captured the essence of our version
                of the Squid Game movie, which served as the backdrop for the station games. During the event, along with another Temasek Polytechnic 
                group leader, we guided a group of attendees as we engaged in the numerous station games organized by my committee. 
                The games were developed to provide players a thrilling and immersive experience, and they were inspired by the popular Netflix series 
                Squid Game.

                It was also my responsibility to ensure that everyone had fun and that the event ran smoothly. I worked closely with my 
                committee to ensure that the games were well-organized, and the participants were engaged throughout the day. It was a challenging task, 
                but seeing the joy and excitement on everyone's faces made it all worthwhile. Ultimately, the Sotong Games was a great occasion that 
                highlighted the Singapore Polytechnic International Students' Club's ingenuity, camaraderie, and passion and I'm glad I was a part of it.

                was a highly anticipated event for everyone at the Singapore Polytechnic 
                International Students' Club (SPISC). I was honored to be a part of this special event as the emcee, 
                to conclude a wonderful academic year packed with exciting activities. My responsibility as the event's 
                emcee was to make sure everyone who attended was amused and engaged. I had spent weeks getting ready for 
                this occasion, gathering information about the activities that took place over the 2021-2022 academic year 
                and organizing the graduation ceremony for each member of the Year-3 committee.

            <p>
                Although the event's online 
                structure posed some special difficulties, we were committed to making the most of it. We produced an 
                interactive experience for all attendees by utilizing interactive websites such as Kahoot and 
                compilation videos of the various activities held throughout the academic year. A lovely video 
                that featured the academic year's highlights opened the event and established the mood for the rest of it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As the emcee, it was my responsibility to maintain the event's enthusiasm and guests' interest. To fulfil 
                my roles, I talked to the attendees, presented some entertaining anecdotes, and even led some enjoyable games 
                and activities. The graduation ceremony, which was a painful time for all the Year-3 committee members, was one 
                of the event's highlights. As we bid them farewell, we wished them success in their future endeavors. I was happy
                to have contributed to the overall success of the Annual General Meeting 2022. It was a wonderful chance to 
                acknowledge our club's accomplishments, pay tribute to our graduating seniors, and anticipate the exciting 
                future events and activities.

                All first-year students looked forward to the annual CCA Carnival which was held between 12nd-14th April 2022, 
                since it gave them a chance to get engaged and learn more about the various CCAs and Clubs at Singapore 
                Polytechnic. I was excited to promote our club and highlight everything we had to offer on hence I participated 
                in it for a day to do so. I eagerly addressed every Burmese student I encountered at the event while wearing my 
                traditional man's outfit (Pa-so), telling them about the club's activities and the benefits of joining us. 
                Many students were drawn to my bright traditional costume and were interested in learning more about the group.

                took place around Singapore Polytechnic's vast campus. These challenges ranged from solving riddles to 
                completing physical tasks, and they were all designed to help the students get to know each other and cooperate
                as a team. As the day went on, I could see that they were growing more comfortable with each other, 
                laughing and chatting as they navigated through the various challenges. It was truly heartwarming to 
                see everyone come together, forging new friendships and creating memories that would last a lifetime. 
                Overall, ISFOP 2 was an incredible success, and I'm so proud to have been a part of it.

                under the sun for the entire day. I checked in with them regularly to ensure that they were feeling

                aspects of the club's identity and goals. The third day of the camp was held in West Coast Park,

                and activities that would help the new committee members bond with each other, develop trust and teamwork, 
                and learn to work together towards a common goal. Through these activities, 
                the they also got a chance to showcase their leadership and 
                communication skills, and we provided feedback to help them improve their skills.

                their roles as SPISC committee members. The Leadership Training Camp was a great success, and I was proud to have

                The holiday season was in full swing at Singapore Polytechnic, and I had the honour to 
                organize a physical collaboration event, called  
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ClygR1XJi1g/" class = "link" target = "_blank">
                    Rediscovering Christmas
                </a> 
                 on 9th December 2022, together with my committee members. It was a festive celebration with 3 other CCAs
                 from Singapore Polytechnic to bring together students from different backgrounds and cultures 
                 to celebrate the joyous occasion of Christmas.

                As part of the event committee, my responsibility was to oversee the preparation and set up of the event hall.
                This involved the purchasing and preparation of logistics and coordinating with my committee members to 
                ensure that the decorations were in place. We wanted to make sure that every participant who joined the 
                event had a great night of fun, food, and festivities.

            <p>
                The event was a great success, with everyone enjoying a delicious dinner and engaging in 
                various games and performances. We organized games that required collaboration and teamwork 
                among participants to promote inter-CCA bonding. The event also featured performances that showcased 
                the talents of students, ranging from singing to dancing. Overall, Rediscovering Christmas was a wonderful
                opportunity for students to rediscover the true spirit of Christmas and create meaningful memories with 
                their peers.

                On the 7th of January 2023, our Singapore Polytechnic International Students' Club (SPISC) held its

                    Annual General Meeting (AGM)
                </a> 
                , which served as the conclusion for all the events executed throughout the 2022/2023 academic year. 
                It was a memorable day for the Year-3 committee members who graduated during the ceremony. As the chair of the event 
                I was in charge of managing the various event departments, such as the Emcees, Game Masters, and Publicity Departments.
                I was responsible for writing the event proposal, communicating with the departments in SP, and purchasing logistics, food,
                and beverages for the event.

                AGM was a unique experience for me as it differed from the events I had previously led or executed. 
                This full indoor semi-formal event was held in a large hall, and I was responsible for organizing dinner, 
                which added an extra layer of complexity to the planning process. Initially, the sheer amount of preparation
                required to successfully execute the event was daunting and challenging. However, I approached the task 
                with determination and eventually overcame these obstacles to deliver an unforgettable experience for all attendees.

                This event was also a stepping-down ceremony for my current committee members as the new batch of junior 
                committee members took over. During the event, I was elected as the Membership Secretary to lead the CCA, 
                along with the four other Excos. As Chair, I ensured that everyone had a great time, and wished the seniors 
                and my batch of committee members a great graduation and luck to their future endeavors. The Annual General 
                Meeting was a memorable event leaving everyone with fond memories of the day which marked the end of one academic 
                year and the beginning of another.
