            <p>
               It has been an amazing experience thus far to be chosen as the 
               Membership Secretary of the 
               <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thespisc/" class = "link" target = "_blank">Singapore Polytechnic International Students' Club.</a>
               I have had the opportunity to lead and contribute to various aspects of the club's activities.

                One of my first few responsibilities as Membership Secretary after the handover was to create the brochure 
                for the club for the academic year 2023/2024. This booklet acts as a reference for the members and offers
                crucial details about the club's goals, events, and activities. The goal of making the brochure both educational 
                and visually appealing was difficult, but with the assistance of my team, we were able to create a thorough brochure
                that successfully conveys the club's message.

                Leading the development and implementation of the International Students' Club Freshmen Orientation Program 
                is another noteworthy accomplishment that I am proud of. The event took place at Singapore Polytechnic's Convention Center
                and was a great success. As a team as well as a committee, we worked tirelessly to ensure that the event runs smoothly, 
                and our efforts paid off as we received positive feedback from the attendees. It was a fantastic opportunity to get to 
                know new students, welcome them to our community, and give them the information they needed to adjust to their new 
                academic and social environment.

                Communication is crucial in the success of any organization, and as the Membership Secretary it is my duty to keep in 
                touch with the Polytechnic's many departments in order to update the information on our Club's webpage on the 
                <a href="https://www.sp.edu.sg/ccas/our-clubs/special-interests/sp-international-students-club" class = "link" target = "_blank">Life@SP website.</a>  
                To fulfill this duty and guarantee that the information accurately reflects the club's activities and events, 
                coordination with many departments is necessary.

                As a Membership Secretary, I am also in charge of various departments, namely the Assistant Secretaries, 
                Community Engagement Program (CEP), Welfare, and Sponsorship departments. I oversee several departments as the 
                membership secretary, including the Assistant Secretaries, Community Engagement Program (CEP), Welfare, and Sponsorship 
                divisions. The Assistant Secretaries Department makes sure that all committee members show up to meetings, takes notes 
                during event discussions and briefings, and helps with committee member administrative issues. The CEP Department's primary 
                goal is to organize and carry out community service-related events in collaboration with various partners, like St Luke's
                ElderCare. The Welfare Department is in charge of looking after the academic and mental well-being of committee members, 
                organizing and carrying out bonding events for the committee members to enjoy and have fun at the end of the academic year,
                and preserving the committee's morale. Lastly, the Sponsorship Department is also in charge of maintaining 
                a smooth partnership process, contacting partners and the school to gain support, and recruiting sponsors 
                for the club's many activities.

                In conclusion, my experience as the Membership Secretary of the Singapore Polytechnic International Students' Club 
                has been both challenging and rewarding. It has given me the chance to grow as a leader, hone my communication abilities, 
                and have opportunities to positively influence the community. As I continue to manage the club and contribute to its 
                growth and success, I am eager to see what this academic year has in store for me.
